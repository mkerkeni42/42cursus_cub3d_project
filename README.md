# Cub3D: A-Maze-ing 3D Adventures! 🎮🌌

## Overview
**Cub3D** is a 3D scene inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*, using **ray-casting** to simulate a first-person labyrinth. 
While it’s not a playable game, it recreates the immersive visuals of a game environment. 
This project was an incredible opportunity to combine math, graphics, and programming skills, making it both a technical and creative journey. 
Built with **MinilibX**, it's where code meets imagination!

## How It Works 🕹️
1. **Compile** the Project with `make`  

2. **Run** the scene:
  ```
  ./cub3D maps/map.cub
  ```

Use W, A, S, D to move and arrow keys to rotate. Quit anytime with ESC.

## Challenges Faced 💥
This project was as demanding as it was rewarding. Yani K. and I teamed up to bring the 3D scene to life: he handled the complex .cub file parsing, and I focused on the graphical implementation. 
Here’s what challenged us:

- **Understanding Math Formulas**: Translating complex ray-casting math into code was a big hurdle. It took time, but the “aha!” moment when it all clicked was incredibly satisfying.   

- **Balancing Art & Code**: Combining technical accuracy with visual creativity turned out to be a unique challenge and a lot of fun.  

## What I Learned 🌱
Cub3D taught me a lot about:

- **Graphics Programming**: Applying ray-casting, texture mapping, and lighting to create a realistic scene.  

- **Creative Problem Solving**: Using math as a tool for visual expression.

- **Teamwork**: Collaborating with Yani K. helped us tackle issues efficiently and bounce ideas back and forth.  

While we would have loved to take it further and make it fully interactive, time was tight with other projects, so we stopped at the project’s requirements.
